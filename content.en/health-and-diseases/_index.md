## 21.8 Diabetes Mellitus

Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder. In Greek (Diabetes – running through; mellitus- sweet). It is characterised by **increased blood glucose level** due to **insufficient, deficient or failure of insulin secretion. This is the most common pancreatic** endocrine disorder. The incidence of Type-1 and Type-2 diabetes is increasing worldwide.

### 21.8.1 Type-1 Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (IDDM)

IDDM accounts for 10 to 20% of the known diabetics. The condition also occurs in children (**juvenile** **onset diabetes**) and **young adults**, the onset is usually sudden and can be life threatening. This is caused by the **destruction of β-cells of the pancreas**. It is characterized by abnormally elevated blood glucose levels (**hyperglycemia**) resulting from **inadequate insulin secretion**. 
**Causes**: Genetic inheritance and environmental factors (infections due to virus, acute stress) are the cause for this condition.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">

<img src="image-5.png" alt="Beautiful landscape" width="400">

</div>


### 21.8.2 Type-2 Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (NIDDM)

This is also called as adult onset diabetes and accounting for 80 to 90% of the diabetic population. It develops slowly, usually milder and more stable. **Insulin production by the pancreas is normal** but its **action is impaired**. The target cells do not respond to insulin. It does not allow the movement of glucose into cells.

**Causes: The causes are multifactorial** which include increasing age (affecting middle aged and older people), obesity, sedentary life style, overeating and physically inactive.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;padding-bottom:30px">

<img src="image-25.png" alt="Beautiful landscape" width="400">

</div>

• Increased blood glucose level (**Hyperglycemia**)

• Increased urine output (**Polyuria**) leading to dehydration

• Loss of water leads to thirst (**Polydipsia**) resulting in increased fluid intake

• Excessive glucose excreted in urine (**Glycosuria**)

• Excess hunger (**Polyphagia**) due to loss of glucose in urine.

• Fatigue and loss of weight

</div>

### 21.8.3 Prevention and Control of Diabetes

Diet, hypoglycemic drugs, insulin injection and exercise are the management options based on the type and severity of the condition. The overall goal of diabetes management is to maintain normal blood glucose level.

**Table 21.1 Differences between Type-1 and Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus**

|  Factors |Type-1 Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) |Type-2 Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) |
|------|------|------|
| Prevalence |10-20% |80-90% |
| Age of onset |Juvenile onset (< 20 years) |Maturity onset (>30 years) |
| B ody weight |Normal or Under weight |Obese |
| Defect |Insulin deciency due to destruction of β-cells |Target cells do respond to insulin |
| Treatment |Insulin administration is necessar y |Can be controlled by diet, exercise and medicine |


  

**Dietary management**: Low carbohydrate and fibre rich diets are more appropriate. Carbohydrates should be taken in the form of starch and complex sugars. Refined sugars (sucrose and glucose) should be avoided. Diet comprising whole grains, millets (jowar, bajra, ragi), green leafy vegetables, wheat and unpolished rice should be included in diet regularly.

Carbohydrates is maintained to about 50- 55% of the total calories. High protein content of 10-15% of the total intake is required to supply essential amino acids. Fat content in the diet should be 15-25% of the total calories. Saturated fat intake should be reduced. Polyunsaturated fatty acid content should be higher.

**Management with insulin**: Commercially available insulin preparations (short and long acting) are also used to maintain blood glucose levels.

**Physical activity**: Exercise plays an important role in facilitating a good control of diabetes, in addition to strengthening and toning up the muscles.

**Education and Awareness**: People with diabetics should be educated on the nature of disease they have and the possibility of complications of the disease, if blood sugar is not kept under control. Instructions regarding diet, exercise and drugs should be explained.

## 21.9 Obesity

Obesity is the state in which there is an accumulation of excess body fat with an **abnormal increase in body weight**. Obesity is a complex multifactorial chronic disease developing from influence of social, behavioural, psychological, metabolic and cellular factors.

Obesity occurs if intake of calories is more than the expenditure of energy. Over weight and obesity are conditions where the body weight is greater than the mean standard weight for age and height of an individual. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of body fat and health risk.

BMI = Weight (kg) / Height (m)2

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;padding-bottom:30px">

<img src="image-19.png" alt="Beautiful landscape" width="400">

## 21.10 Heart Disease

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is associated with diseases of the heart and blood vessels. **Coronary heart disease** (CHD) is the most common form and is caused by **deposition of cholesterol in the blood vessels**.

It usually develops slowly over many years beginning from childhood, they may form a fatty streak to a fibrous complicated plaque. It leads to the narrowing of blood vessels leading to **atherosclerosis** in the large and medium sized arteries that supply the heart muscle with oxygen. It leads to sudden ischemia (deficient blood supply to heart muscle) and **myocardial infarction** (death of the heart muscle tissue).

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;padding-bottom:30px">

<img src="image-16.png" alt="Beautiful landscape" width="400">

</div>



**Risk factors**: Hypercholesterolemia (High blood cholesterol) and high blood pressure (Hypertension) are the major causes and contributing factors for heart disease and if untreated may cause severe damage to brain, kidney and eventually lead to stroke. **Causes**: Heredity (family history), diet rich in saturated fat and cholesterol, obesity, increasing age, cigarette smoking, emotional stress, sedentary lifestyle, excessive alcohol consumption and physical inactivity are some of the causes.   
**Symptoms:** Shortness of breath, headache, tiredness, dizziness, chest pain, swelling of leg, and gastrointestinal disturbances.

## 21.11 Cancer

Cancer causes about 4 million deaths annually throughout the world. In India more than one million people suffer from cancer. Cancer is derived from Latin word meaning crab. The study of cancer is called Oncology (**Oncos- Tumor**).

Cancer is an abnormal and uncontrolled division of cells that invade and destroy surrounding tissue forming a tumor or **neoplasm** (new growth). It is a heterogenous group of cells that do not respond to the normal cell division.

The cancerous cells migrate to distant parts of the body and affect new tissues. This process is called metastasis. The frequent sites of metastasis are lungs, bones, liver, skin and brain. 

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;padding-bottom:30px">

<img src="image-14.png" alt="Beautiful landscape" width="400">

</div>

### 21.11.1 Types of Cancers

Cancers are classified on the basis of the tissues from which they are formed. 
1. **Carcinomas** arise from **epithelial** and **glandular tissues. They include cancers of** skin, lung, stomach and brain. About 85% of the tumours are carcinomas

2. **Sarcomas** are occur in the **connective** and **muscular tissue. They include the cancer** of bones, cartilage, tendons, adipose tissue and muscles. These form 1% of all tumours.

3. **Leukaemia** are characterized by an increase in the formation of white blood cells in the bone marrow and lymph nodes. Leukaemia are called **blood cancers.** Most common type of cancer which also affect children below 15 years of age.

### 21.11.2 Carcinogenic Agents

Cancer causing agents are called **carcinogens**. They are physical, chemical agents, ionizing radiations and biological agents.

**Physical Irritant:** Heavy smoking causes lung cancer and cancers of oral cavity, pharynx (throat) and larynx. Betel and tobacco chewing causes oral cancer. Excessive exposure to sunlight may cause skin cancer. 

**Chemical agents:** Nicotine, caffeine, products of combustion of coal and oil, pesticides, asbestos, nickel, certain dyes and artificial sweetners induce cancer. 

**Radiations:** Ionizing radiations like X-rays, gamma- rays, radioactive substances and non- ionising radiations like UV rays cause DNA damage leading to cancer. 

**Biological agents:** Cancer causing viruses are called oncogenic viruses.

### 21.11.3 Treatment of Cancer

The treatment of cancer involves the following methods:     
**Surgery:** Tumours are removed by surgery to prevent further spread of cancer cells.   
**Radiation therapy**: Tumour cells are irradiated by lethal doses of radiation while protecting the surrounding normal cells.   
**Chemotherapy:** It involves administration of anticancerous drugs which prevent cell division and are used to kill cancer cells.  
 **Immunotherapy:** Biological response modifiers like interferons are used to activate the immune system and help in destroying the tumors.


### 21.11.4 Preventive measures for Cancer

Cancer control programmes should focus on primary prevention and early detection.
To prevent lung cancer tobacco smoking is to be avoided and protective measures to be taken against exposure to toxic pollutants of industries. Excessive exposure to radiation is to be avoided to prevent skin cancer.

## 21.12 AIDS (Acquired Immunedeficiency Syndrome)

AIDS is a severe viral disease and caused by Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). It is a condition in which immune system fails and suppress the body’s disease fighting **mechanism. They attack the lymphocytes and** the affected individual is prone to infectious diseases.
